# Overview

**Written By:** Jason Wells

This script provides a way to generate PDF files which are a combination of individual per item PDF files. Files are grouped by family membership. Items which are not a member of a family will yield a PDF with only the single item.

# Getting Started

## Setup

Begin by downloading the latest release of this code.  Extract the contents of the archive into your Nuix scripts directory.  In Windows the script directory is likely going to be either of the following:

- `%appdata%\Nuix\Scripts` - User level script directory
- `%programdata%\Nuix\Scripts` - System level script directory

## Usage

See [help file](https://github.com/NuixSDK/Export-Family-PDFs/blob/master/Ruby/ExportFamilyPDFs.nuixscript/Help.md) for details on usage.
